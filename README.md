MusicGen is a Deep learning algorithm, that's trained to create new Music tune after getting a few initial notes as an input. This model is trained using the musical lyrics of Franz Schubert. In this problem, I attempted to imitate his work by completing one of his songs "The Unfinished Symphony" which he composed halfway and could not complete due to his sudden death.
